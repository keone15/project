Analysis of Specifications

Analysis of specifications is where you identify the inputs, outputs, and processes performed by the code. An example process in a blackjack game would be "generate a random card for the user". This section must contain an IPO chart for each function.

Main

Fill in the values in the IPO Chart. See video in Canvas for example.

Input	Process	Output
Text	Text	Text
Pseudocode

Paste pseudocode here

BEGIN Main
    DECLARE String name
END
Flowchart

Paste flowchart image here. Note that the image has to uploaded to your repository and then a link added here

Test cases should include edge cases (values near the upper and lower bounds of the allowed values), and acceptable and unacceptable values. Produce at least 5 unique cases.

Example (remove from submission)

Case #	Case Description	Input	Condition (price > creditLimit)	Output
1	Item that should be approved	Price = 7800	False	Approved
2	Item that should be approved (edge case)	Price = 8000	False	Approved
3	Item that should not be approved	Price = 10000	True	Not Approved
